****STRING LITERALS*****
String str1 = "Hello World!!!";

The value is stored in Heap Memory

has a address location on a stack

321 (location) 

String str2 = "Hello World!!!";
BOTH would point to 321 location (java will optimize code)

-memory location is the same


*****String Object*****
String str3 = new String("Hello World!!");

741 location

String str4 = new String("Hello World!!");

943 location

when doing str3 == str4 will be FALSE



---------------------------------------------

.equals should be used to compare strings

USE STRING LITERALS USUALLY. (due to code optimization)
